A simple program that creates a hidden soundplayer only visible through joblist, waits certain amount of time and then force-unmutes the default playback device, sets volume to 100% and plays "n'dokowaoh" from "Osman og Jeppe".

All resources are embedded in the exe file by using the Costura add-in for Fody
